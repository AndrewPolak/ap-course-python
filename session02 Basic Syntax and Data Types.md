## Session 2: Basic Syntax and Data Types

### Introduction

In this session, we focus on Python’s fundamental building blocks—variables, data types, and basic syntax. While Session 1 introduced the environment and basic I/O, we now dive deeper into how Python represents and manipulates data. By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand how Python’s indentation and syntax convey code structure.
- Know how variables are assigned, reassigned, and typed dynamically.
- Distinguish between integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Use arithmetic operators and understand integer vs. float division.
- Format and manipulate strings for readable output.
- Convert data between different types (int, float, str, bool).
- Use these fundamental constructs in short exercises that simulate common programming tasks.

---

## 1. Explanations

### Python’s Syntax and Code Blocks

Unlike languages that rely heavily on braces `{}` or keywords, Python uses indentation to group code. Indentation (commonly 4 spaces) after statements like `if`, `for`, or `def` indicates the code that belongs to that block. This design choice makes code visually clean and forces consistent formatting.

**Example:**
```python
if True:
    print("This line is inside the if-block")
print("This line is outside the if-block")
```

If you remove the indentation before the `print("This line is inside the if-block")`, Python will throw a syntax error. This strictness ensures code that is easy to read, maintain, and debug.

**Comments:**  
Start with `#`. Everything after `#` on that line is ignored. Use comments to clarify logic, but keep them concise.  
```python
# This is a comment
x = 10  # Inline comment after code
```

**No Semicolons Needed:**  
A newline typically ends a statement. You can use semicolons, but it’s unusual in Python. Stick to one statement per line for clarity.

**Reference:** [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

---

### Variables and Dynamic Typing

In Python, you don’t declare variable types explicitly. Instead, Python infers the type from the assigned value. This is called **dynamic typing**. The variable name is a reference to an object in memory. If you do:
```python
x = 42
```
`x` now refers to an integer object with the value `42`. Later, if you write:
```python
x = "Hello"
```
`x` now refers to a string. Python’s flexibility allows rapid prototyping, but you must be careful—changing a variable’s type can cause confusion if done unintentionally.

**Variable Naming:**  
- Start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, and underscores.
- Avoid Python keywords like `if`, `for`, `while`.
- Use meaningful names for clarity. For example: `total_price`, `user_age`.

**Checking Types:**
```python
age = 30
print(type(age))  # <class 'int'>
```

---

### Data Types: int, float, str, bool

**Integers (`int`):**  
Whole numbers without a fractional component. Python’s `int` can be arbitrarily large, limited only by available memory.  
```python
count = 100
```

**Floats (`float`):**  
Real numbers with decimal points. They are implemented using double precision floating-point format. Keep in mind that float arithmetic can introduce rounding errors.  
```python
price = 3.99
```

**Strings (`str`):**  
A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Strings are **immutable** (you cannot change them in place).  
```python
greeting = "Hello"
print(greeting[0])  # 'H'
print(len(greeting))  # 5
```
Strings can be concatenated:
```python
full_greet = greeting + " World"
```
Sliced:
```python
part = greeting[1:4]  # "ell"
```
Formatted using f-strings:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

**Booleans (`bool`):**  
Only two values: `True` or `False`. Often the result of comparisons or logical operations.  
```python
is_active = True
if is_active:
    print("System is active!")
```

**Reference:** [Built-in Types – Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)

---

### Arithmetic and Operators

Python supports a variety of arithmetic operators:

- `+` Addition  
- `-` Subtraction  
- `*` Multiplication  
- `/` Division (always returns float)  
- `//` Integer (floor) division  
- `%` Modulus (remainder)  
- `**` Exponentiation

**Examples:**
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)  # 13
print(x / y)  # 3.3333...
print(x // y) # 3 (floor division)
print(x % y)  # 1 (remainder)
print(x ** y) # 1000 (10^3)
```

**Type Conversion:**
- `int("42")` → `42`
- `float("3.14")` → `3.14`
- `str(100)` → `"100"`
- `bool(0)` → `False`; `bool(1)` → `True`

You often need to convert types after reading user input since `input()` returns a string.  
```python
num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
num = int(num_str)
print(num * 2)
```

---

### Practical Usage

Combining these concepts, you might ask a user for two numbers, convert them to integers, perform arithmetic, and print the result. Or you might gather a user’s first and last name as strings, then print a formatted greeting. These basic operations form the foundation of more complex programs you’ll write later.

**Try Interactive Experiments:**  
Open a Python REPL (`python3`) and experiment:
```python
>>> a = input("Enter a: ")
Enter a: 5
>>> b = input("Enter b: ")
Enter b: 10
>>> a_int = int(a)
>>> b_int = int(b)
>>> print(a_int + b_int)
15
```

This direct feedback loop helps solidify your understanding of these fundamentals before we move into more complex tasks.

## 2. Exercises

We will now practice the introduced concepts with a series of exercises. Each exercise includes starter code right below the description, so you can begin working immediately. The exercises increase in complexity and integrate multiple concepts as you progress.

### Exercise 1: Variables and Types

**Description:**  
Create variables of different types (int, float, str) and print them along with their types.

**What to Do:**
1. Assign `x` as an integer (e.g., `10`).
2. Assign `y` as a float (e.g., `3.14`).
3. Assign `name` as a string (e.g., `"Alice"`).
4. Print each variable and its type in the format:  
   `x = 10 (type: <class 'int'>)`

**No Input Required**  
**Expected Output Example:**
```
x = 10 (type: <class 'int'>)
y = 3.14 (type: <class 'float'>)
name = Alice (type: <class 'str'>)
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: vars_and_types.py
def main():
    # TODO: Assign variables and print them as described.
    # Hint: Use type() to get the type of a variable.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Exercise 2: Arithmetic from User Input

**Description:**  
Prompt the user for two integers and perform arithmetic operations.

**What to Do:**
1. Read two lines of input.
2. Convert them to integers `a` and `b`.
3. Print their sum, difference, product, integer division (`a // b`), and remainder (`a % b`).

**Input Example:**
```
8
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sum: 11
Difference: 5
Product: 24
Integer Division: 2
Remainder: 2
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: arithmetic_io.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Input two integers a and b.
    # 2. Print sum, difference (a - b), product, integer division (a // b), remainder (a % b).
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Exercise 3: String Formatting

**Description:**  
Use input strings and f-strings to create a formatted message.

**What to Do:**
1. Prompt for `first_name`.
2. Prompt for `last_name`.
3. Print: `"Hello, <first_name> <last_name>, welcome to the Python world!"`

**Input Example:**
```
John
Doe
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hello, John Doe, welcome to the Python world!
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: string_format.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read first_name and last_name.
    # 2. Print the formatted message using an f-string.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Exercise 4: Type Conversion and Simple Math

**Description:**  
Read a numeric string, convert it to an integer, add 10, and print the result.

**What to Do:**
1. Prompt the user for a string representing a number (e.g. "42").
2. Convert it to an integer.
3. Add 10.
4. Print the result.

**Input Example:**
```
42
```

**Expected Output:**
```
52
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: type_conversion.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read a string from input.
    # 2. Convert it to int.
    # 3. Add 10.
    # 4. Print the result.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 5: Boolean Check

**Description:**  
Determine if a given number is greater than 10.

**What to Do:**
1. Prompt for a number.
2. Print "True" if the number > 10, else "False".

**Input Example:**
```
12
```

**Expected Output:**
```
True
```

For input `7`, output should be `False`.

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: bool_check.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read a number.
    # 2. Print "True" if > 10, otherwise "False".
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 4. Autotests

The autotest scripts run both your solution and the reference solution with various inputs, ensuring your output matches the expected output. Each script can be adapted to different exercises by changing inputs and comparison logic.

**Example for Exercise 1 (vars_and_types_test.py):**  
Since Exercise 1 has no input and fixed output, we’ll just compare the two outputs directly.

```python
# Save as: vars_and_types_test.py
import subprocess

def run_solution(solution_file):
    completed_process = subprocess.run(
        ["python3", solution_file],
        text=True,
        capture_output=True
    )
    if completed_process.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Solution {solution_file} crashed:\n{completed_process.stderr}")
    return completed_process.stdout.strip().split('\n')

def test_solutions(student_solution_file, reference_solution_file):
    ref_output = run_solution(reference_solution_file)
    student_output = run_solution(student_solution_file)

    if len(ref_output) != len(student_output):
        raise AssertionError(f"Line count mismatch: expected {len(ref_output)} lines, got {len(student_output)}.")
    for i, (r_line, s_line) in enumerate(zip(ref_output, student_output)):
        if r_line != s_line:
            raise AssertionError(f"Line {i+1} mismatch:\nExpected: {r_line}\nGot: {s_line}")

    print("All tests passed for Exercise 1.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions("vars_and_types.py", "vars_and_types_sol.py")
```

**Example for Exercise 2 (arithmetic_io_test.py):**  
We will provide multiple test cases. The autotest runs both solutions with the same input and compares line-by-line.

```python
# Save as: arithmetic_io_test.py
import subprocess

def run_solution(solution_file, input_data):
    completed_process = subprocess.run(
        ["python3", solution_file],
        input=input_data,
        text=True,
        capture_output=True
    )
    if completed_process.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Solution {solution_file} crashed with input:\n{input_data}\nStderr:\n{completed_process.stderr}")
    return completed_process.stdout.strip().split('\n')

def test_solutions(student_solution_file, reference_solution_file):
    test_cases = [
        ("8\n3\n", ["Sum: 11", "Difference: 5", "Product: 24", "Integer Division: 2", "Remainder: 2"]),
        ("10\n10\n", ["Sum: 20", "Difference: 0", "Product: 100", "Integer Division: 1", "Remainder: 0"])
    ]

    for input_data, expected_output in test_cases:
        # Run reference solution to confirm expected output (optional step if we trust the solution)
        # ref_output = run_solution(reference_solution_file, input_data)
        # For this example, we use the known expected_output directly.

        student_output = run_solution(student_solution_file, input_data)
        if student_output != expected_output:
            raise AssertionError(
                f"For input:\n{input_data}\nExpected: {expected_output}\nGot: {student_output}"
            )

    print("All tests passed for Exercise 2.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions("arithmetic_io.py", "arithmetic_io_sol.py")
```

*You would create similar test files (`string_format_test.py`, `type_conversion_test.py`, `bool_check_test.py`) following the same pattern:  
- Define `run_solution()`.  
- Provide a set of test cases (input → expected output).  
- Compare line-by-line.*

This ensures the student’s solution behaves exactly like the reference solution under various scenarios.
