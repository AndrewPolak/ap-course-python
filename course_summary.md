## Multi-Stage Assignment #1: To-Do List Manager (CLI)

**Overall Goal:**  
Build a command-line application to manage to-do tasks. As the course progresses, the to-do manager will evolve from a simple in-memory list to a fully tested, persistent, object-oriented, and style-compliant application with type hints and command-line argument parsing.

### Stage 1 (Introduced around Session 10)  
**Goals:**  
- Create a basic CLI application that allows adding and removing tasks in memory.  
- Reinforce basic Python syntax, I/O, and data structures.

**Requirements:**  
- The user can add a task by typing a command (e.g., `add "Buy groceries"`).  
- The user can list all current tasks.  
- The user can remove tasks by specifying their index or name.  
- All data is stored in memory only and is lost when the program exits.  
- Minimal error handling: if a command is invalid, just print a message.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Basic Python coding and I/O  
- Using lists/dicts for storage  
- Simple control flow and user input handling

### Stage 2 (Around Session 14)  
**Goals:**  
- Introduce file persistence so tasks are saved between runs.

**Requirements:**  
- On startup, the program attempts to load tasks from a text file or JSON file.  
- On exit, tasks are saved back to the file.  
- Handle cases where the file doesn’t exist gracefully, creating it if needed.  
- Improve error messages and basic validations.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- File I/O operations  
- Basic error handling and data persistence

- Create a `TaskManager` class to handle adding, removing, listing, and saving tasks.  
- Refactor code from procedural style to OOP, improving maintainability.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Object-oriented design and refactoring  
- Encapsulation and class-based architecture  
- Laying the groundwork for future expansions

### Stage 4 (Around Session 25, Final)  
**Goals:**  
- Add advanced features: JSON storage, command-line arguments, error handling, testing, and type hints.

**Requirements:**  
- Store tasks as JSON for structured, flexible persistence.  
- Use `argparse` to support commands like `--add`, `--remove`, `--list` from the CLI.  
- Introduce unit tests for key functionalities using `unittest`.  
- Add type hints and run `mypy` to ensure type correctness.  
- Ensure code meets PEP 8 standards and is version-controlled with Git.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- JSON serialization/deserialization  
- Command-line argument parsing  
- Automated testing and static analysis with type hints

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Building a standalone tool with a focus on processing input/output  
- Reinforcing modular code practices learned earlier

### Stage 2 (Around Session 35)  
**Goals:**

**Requirements (Choose appropriate complexity based on course direction):**  
- If concurrency: Use `threading` or `multiprocessing` to process data in parallel.  
- If APIs: Fetch additional data from a web API and incorporate it into the output.  
- Add transformations (e.g., filtering lines that match certain criteria, formatting results).

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Handling more complex operations (concurrent processing or API integration)  
- Improving performance and feature richness

### Stage 3 (Around Session 36)  
**Goals:**

**Requirements:**  
- Store processed results in a SQLite database for persistent records.  
- Validate input data before processing to prevent errors or injections.  
- Possibly handle user-provided configuration or credentials securely.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**

- Security considerations (safe handling of input, avoiding common vulnerabilities)

### Stage 4 (Around Session 38, Final)  
**Goals:**  
- Add performance profiling, logging/monitoring, and package the pipeline for distribution.

**Requirements:**  
- Use `logging` to record pipeline operations, errors, and events.  
- Profile the pipeline to identify bottlenecks and implement optimizations.  
- Create a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to package the pipeline application, enabling easy installation and distribution.  
- Ensure tests are in place (unit and integration tests), code passes linting and type checks.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Performance optimization and profiling  
- Logging and monitoring for maintainability and troubleshooting  
- Packaging and distributing code professionally

**End Result:**  
A sophisticated data processing pipeline with concurrency or API integration, database persistence, secure handling, performance optimizations, logging, and proper packaging, demonstrating intermediate to advanced Python development skills.
