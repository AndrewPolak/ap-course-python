## Session 4: Working with Lists & Tuples

### Introduction

In previous sessions, we explored Python’s syntax, data types, and how to manipulate strings and user input. Now we turn our focus to two fundamental data structures: **lists** and **tuples**. These are core building blocks in Python that allow you to store and manipulate collections of values. By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Create, index, slice, and modify lists.
- Use common list methods to add, remove, and search elements.
- Understand tuple immutability and how to pack/unpack tuples.
- Combine lists and tuples effectively in real-world scenarios (e.g., processing input data, grouping related values).

---

## 1. Explanations

### Lists

**What is a List?**  
A list is an ordered, mutable collection of items. You can think of it as a flexible array that can store integers, floats, strings, and even other lists. Because lists are mutable, you can change them in-place—adding, removing, or modifying elements without creating a new list.

**Creating Lists:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0, [4, 5]]
```

**Accessing Elements:**
Lists are zero-indexed:
```python
print(fruits[0])  # "apple"
print(fruits[-1]) # "cherry" (last element)
```

**Slicing Lists:**
Similar to string slicing:
```python
print(fruits[1:3]) # ["banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[:2])  # ["apple", "banana"]
print(fruits[::2]) # ["apple", "cherry"] (every second element)
```

**Modifying Lists:**
You can assign to a slice or index:
```python
fruits[0] = "apricot"     # replaces "apple" with "apricot"
fruits[1:3] = ["blueberry", "cranberry"] # replace slice
```

**Common List Methods:**
- `append(item)`: Add item to the end.
- `insert(index, item)`: Insert item at given position.
- `remove(item)`: Remove first occurrence of item.
- `pop(index=-1)`: Remove and return item at index (default last).
- `count(item)`: Returns how many times item occurs.
- `index(item)`: Returns index of first occurrence of item.
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the list in place.

Example:
```python
numbers = [10, 5, 7]
numbers.append(3)     # [10, 5, 7, 3]
numbers.sort()         # [3, 5, 7, 10]
numbers.remove(5)      # [3, 7, 10]
value = numbers.pop()  # Removes and returns last element -> 10, list now [3, 7]
```

**Why Lists are Useful:**
Lists are extremely versatile. They let you store data read from files, manipulate collections of user inputs, or maintain dynamic sequences of items in an application.

**Reference:** [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

---

### Tuples

**What is a Tuple?**  
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items. Immutable means you cannot add, remove, or change items once the tuple is created. Tuples are often used to group related but different pieces of data together (e.g., coordinates `(x, y)`, or returning multiple values from a function).

**Creating Tuples:**
```python
point = (10, 20)
single_element = (42,)    # Note the trailing comma for single-element tuple
```

**Accessing Elements:**
Tuples use zero-based indexing just like lists:
```python
print(point[0])  # 10
print(point[-1]) # 20
```

**Immutability:**
```python
point[0] = 30  # Error! Tuples cannot be modified after creation.
```

**Tuple Unpacking:**
A powerful feature of tuples is unpacking:
```python
x, y = point  # x=10, y=20
```

This is often used for returning multiple values from a function:
```python
def min_and_max(values):
    return (min(values), max(values))

lowest, highest = min_and_max([3,1,7,2])
print(lowest, highest)  # 1 7
```

**Why Tuples?**
- Tuples ensure data integrity since they can’t be altered.
- Perfect for fixed-size collections.
- Easy to pass around groups of values without defining a custom class.

**Reference:** [Python Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)

### Combining Lists and Tuples

You might use lists to store dynamic data (e.g., a list of student names) and tuples to store structured records that shouldn’t change (e.g., (student_id, enrollment_date)). You can also have lists of tuples or tuples of lists, depending on the scenario.

**Example:**
```python
students = [
    ("Alice", 20),
    ("Bob", 19),
    ("Charlie", 21)
]

for name, age in students:
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

Here we have a list of tuples. The list can grow or shrink, but each tuple’s structure remains the same, maintaining consistent data formatting.

## 2. Exercises

We will practice creating, modifying, and using lists and tuples. Each exercise includes starter code. Write your solution in the indicated section, then test it with the provided autotest scripts after comparing it to the reference solutions.

### Exercise 1: List Basics

**Description:**  
1. Prompt the user for 3 items (e.g., fruits).
2. Store them in a list.
3. Print the entire list.
4. Print the first and last item using indexing.

**Input Example:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Full list: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
First item: apple
Last item: cherry
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: list_basics.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read 3 items from the user.
    # 2. Store them in a list.
    # 3. Print the full list.
    # 4. Print the first and last items.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 2: List Methods

**Description:**  
1. Start with a predefined list of integers: `[10, 5, 7]`.
2. Append a user-provided number to the list.
3. Remove the smallest number from the list.
4. Print the updated list and its length.

**Input Example:**
```
3
```

**Expected Output (after adding 3 and removing smallest):**
```
Updated list: [5, 7, 10, 3]
Length: 4
```

If the user enters `5` (which already exists), removing the smallest number (which might be 5) still applies. Just ensure the logic holds for any input.

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: list_methods.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Start with list [10, 5, 7].
    # 2. Prompt the user for a number and append it.
    # 3. Remove the smallest number from the list.
    # 4. Print the updated list and its length.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 3: Tuple Unpacking

**Description:**  
1. Create a tuple with exactly 2 elements (e.g., `(42, "Answer")`).
2. Unpack the tuple into two separate variables.
3. Print both variables.

**No Input Required**  
**Example:**
For a tuple `(42, "Answer")`, you might print:
```
Value: 42
Label: Answer
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: tuple_unpacking.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Create a tuple with 2 elements.
    # 2. Unpack it into two variables.
    # 3. Print the variables.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 4: Combining Lists and Tuples

**Description:**  
1. Prompt the user for 2 names.
2. Prompt the user for 2 ages (integers).
3. Create a list of two tuples: `[(name1, age1), (name2, age2)]`.
4. Print each name and age in a formatted string: `"Name: X, Age: Y"`.

**Input Example:**
```
Alice
Bob
20
25
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Name: Alice, Age: 20
Name: Bob, Age: 25
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: list_tuple_combo.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Prompt for 2 names.
    # 2. Prompt for 2 ages.
    # 3. Create a list of tuples [(name1, age1), (name2, age2)].
    # 4. Print each entry as "Name: X, Age: Y".
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

        if r_line != s_line:
            raise AssertionError(f"Line {i+1} mismatch.\nExpected: {r_line}\nGot: {s_line}")

    print("All tests passed for list_basics.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions("list_basics.py", "list_basics_sol.py")
