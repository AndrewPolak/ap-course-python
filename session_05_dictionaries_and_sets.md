## Session 5: Dictionaries & Sets

### Introduction

In previous sessions, we explored lists and tuples for storing ordered collections of data. In this session, we introduce two powerful and commonly used data structures in Python:

- **Dictionaries:** Unordered mappings of keys to values, perfect for fast lookups and flexible data modeling.
- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements, ideal for membership tests, eliminating duplicates, and performing mathematical set operations.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Create and use dictionaries to store key-value pairs.
- Retrieve, add, update, and delete entries in dictionaries.
- Use dictionary methods to iterate, check membership, and handle missing keys.
- Create sets and perform operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Combine dictionaries and sets to solve practical data organization problems.

## 1. Explanations

### Dictionaries

A **dictionary** in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a hash map or associative array in other languages. Keys are unique and must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be any type.

**Creating Dictionaries:**
```python
phonebook = {
    "Alice": "555-1234",
    "Bob": "555-5678"
}
```
You can also create empty dictionaries and add entries later:
```python
phonebook = {}
phonebook["Charlie"] = "555-9999"
```

**Accessing Values:**
```python
print(phonebook["Alice"])  # "555-1234"
```

If you attempt to access a key that doesn't exist, Python raises a `KeyError`. Use `get()` to avoid this:
```python
print(phonebook.get("Eve", "Not found"))  # "Not found" if Eve isn't a key
```

**Modifying Dictionaries:**

- Add or update: `phonebook["Dana"] = "555-7777"`
- Delete a key: `del phonebook["Bob"]`
- Check if key exists: `"Alice" in phonebook` → True/False

**Dictionary Methods:**

- `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`: to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs.
- `pop(key, default)`: remove and return value, or return default if key not found.
- `update(other_dict)`: merge another dictionary into this one.

**Why Dictionaries?**
They offer O(1) average-time complexity lookups, making them essential for quick data retrieval by key. They’re great for configurations, counting occurrences (like a frequency map), caching results, or representing structured data.

**Reference:** [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

---

### Sets

A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful when you only care about whether an element is present or not, and you don’t want duplicates.

**Creating Sets:**
```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
empty_set = set()  # Use set(), not {}, because {} creates an empty dictionary
```

**Basic Operations:**

- Add: `fruits.add("orange")`
- Remove: `fruits.remove("banana")` (raises KeyError if not present)
- Safely remove: `fruits.discard("banana")` (no error if missing)
- Check membership: `"apple" in fruits`
  
**Set Operations:**

- Union: `set1 | set2` or `set1.union(set2)`
- Intersection: `set1 & set2` or `set1.intersection(set2)`
- Difference: `set1 - set2` or `set1.difference(set2)`
- Symmetric Difference: `set1 ^ set2` or `set1.symmetric_difference(set2)`

These operations are very efficient and make sets valuable for tasks like removing duplicates or identifying common elements across collections.

**Why Sets?**
They are ideal for membership tests, ensuring uniqueness, and performing fast set algebra on large collections of data.

**Reference:** [Python Sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

### Combining Dictionaries and Sets

Dictionaries and sets often work together. For instance, you might use a dictionary to store user profiles keyed by username, and a set to track which usernames are currently online. Or use a dictionary to count occurrences of items, then convert the keys to a set to analyze the distinct items.

**Example:**
```python
inventory = {
    "apple": 10,
    "banana": 5,
    "orange": 0
}
in_stock = {item for item, count in inventory.items() if count > 0}
print(in_stock)  # {"apple", "banana"}
```

Here we convert dictionary data into a set for quick membership checks and logical operations.

## 2. Exercises

### Exercise 1: Dictionary Basics

**Description:**  

1. Prompt the user for a name and a phone number.
2. Create a dictionary with that single entry.
3. Print the dictionary.
4. Print the phone number by accessing it via the name.

**Input Example:**
```
Alice
555-1234
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Dictionary: {'Alice': '555-1234'}
Alice's number is: 555-1234
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: dict_basics.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Prompt for a name and phone number.
    # 2. Create a dictionary with {name: phone_number}.
    # 3. Print the dictionary.
    # 4. Print the phone number using the dictionary.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 2: Dictionary Methods

**Description:**  

1. Start with a dictionary `grades = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90}`.
2. Prompt the user for a name and a new grade.
3. Update the dictionary with this name and grade.  
   - If the name already exists, update the grade.
   - If not, add a new entry.
4. Remove one student’s name (prompt for which one) from the dictionary using `pop()`.
5. Print the final dictionary keys and values separately.

**Input Example:**
```
Charlie
95
Bob
```

**If we start with {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90} and user says:**

- Add Charlie: {"Alice":85, "Bob":90, "Charlie":95}
- Remove Bob: {"Alice":85, "Charlie":95}

**Expected Output:**
```
Keys: ['Alice', 'Charlie']
Values: [85, 95]
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: dict_methods.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. grades = {"Alice":85, "Bob":90}
    # 2. Prompt for name and grade, update or add.
    # 3. Prompt for a name to remove, use pop().
    # 4. Print keys and values.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 3: Set Basics

**Description:**  

1. Prompt the user for 5 items, store them in a set (to ensure uniqueness).
2. Print the set.
3. Check if a specific item (prompted from user) is in the set.
4. Print how many unique items are in the set.

**Input Example:**
```
apple
banana
banana
cherry
apple
orange
```

*(User enters 5 items first, e.g., apple, banana, banana, cherry, apple. Then a 6th input "orange" to check membership.)*

**After entering the 5 items, if they are "apple", "banana", "banana", "cherry", "apple", the set might be `{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}`. Then user enters "orange" to check membership: not in the set.**

**Expected Output:**
```
Set of items: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
Is 'orange' in the set? False
Number of unique items: 3
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: set_basics.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Prompt for 5 items, add them to a set.
    # 2. Print the set.
    # 3. Prompt for another item and check membership.
    # 4. Print the count of unique items.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Exercise 4: Combining Dictionaries and Sets

**Description:**  

1. Prompt the user for 3 key-value pairs (e.g., item and quantity).
2. Store them in a dictionary, e.g. `inventory = {item: quantity, ...}`.
3. Create a set of all items that have a quantity greater than 0.
4. Print the set of in-stock items.

**Input Example:**
```
apple
10
banana
0
cherry
5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
In-stock items: {'apple', 'cherry'}
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: dict_set_combo.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Prompt for 3 item-quantity pairs.
    # 2. Store in a dictionary.
    # 3. Create a set of items with quantity > 0.
    # 4. Print the set.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 4. Autotests

**dict_basics_test.py:**
```python
# Save as: dict_basics_test.py
import subprocess

def run_solution(solution_file, input_data):
    completed_process = subprocess.run(
        ["python3", solution_file],
        input=input_data,
        text=True,
        capture_output=True
    )
    if completed_process.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"{solution_file} crashed:\n{completed_process.stderr}")
    return completed_process.stdout.strip().split('\n')

def test_solutions(student_solution_file, reference_solution_file):
    input_data = "Alice\n555-1234\n"
    ref_output = run_solution(reference_solution_file, input_data)
    student_output = run_solution(student_solution_file, input_data)

    if len(ref_output) != len(student_output):
        raise AssertionError("Output line count mismatch.")
    for i, (r_line, s_line) in enumerate(zip(ref_output, student_output)):
        if r_line != s_line:
            raise AssertionError(f"Line {i+1} mismatch.\nExpected: {r_line}\nGot: {s_line}")

    print("All tests passed for dict_basics.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions("dict_basics.py", "dict_basics_sol.py")
```

*Similarly, you can create `dict_methods_test.py`, `set_basics_test.py`, and `dict_set_combo_test.py` following the same pattern: provide input, run both solutions, compare outputs line by line.*
