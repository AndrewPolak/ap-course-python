## Session 3: String Manipulation & Basic Input/Output

### Introduction

In the previous sessions, we explored Python’s environment setup, basic syntax, variables, data types, and arithmetic operations. In this session, we will focus on Python’s powerful string capabilities and combine them with input/output (I/O) operations to interact more meaningfully with users and data. After completing this session, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply string slicing to extract substrings.
- Use f-strings to produce clear, dynamic output.
- Read user input and process it into meaningful chunks.
- Format and reformat textual data based on user input.
- Develop comfort with combining input reading, string manipulation, and printing results.

## 1. Explanations

### String Slicing

A **string** in Python can be thought of as an ordered sequence of characters. Each character can be accessed by an index, starting at 0. String slicing is the ability to extract portions (substrings) from a string using a start and end index, and an optional step:

**Syntax:**  
```python
substring = my_string[start:end:step]
```
- `start`: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).
- `end`: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).
- `step`: How much to increment the index by each time (optional).

**Examples:**
```python
text = "Hello, World!"
# Extract "Hello"
greeting = text[0:5]          # "Hello"
# Extract "World"
world = text[7:12]            # "World"
# Omit start or end for defaults
start_to_five = text[:5]      # "Hello"
from_seven_to_end = text[7:]  # "World!"
# Negative indexing (count from end)
last_char = text[-1]          # "!"
# Use steps (e.g., every second character)
evens = text[::2]             # "Hlo ol!"
```

Slicing allows you to break down input strings, extract parts of filenames, process user-submitted data, or clean up raw text before further processing.

For more details, see [String Slicing in the Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

### f-Strings for Output Formatting

**f-strings** (formatted string literals) let you embed Python expressions directly inside string constants. They are defined by prefixing a string with `f` or `F`.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

This makes dynamic output straightforward, readable, and concise. You can use f-strings to format user input, results of computations, or slices of strings without cumbersome concatenation or the older `.format()` method.

**Advanced f-string Capabilities:**
- Expressions: `f"The sum is {2 + 3}."`
- Function calls: `f"Upper: {name.upper()}"`

**Reference:** [Python f-Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)

### Basic Input (input()) and Output (print())

We’ve used `print()` to display information. Now we’ll integrate `input()` to gather data from the user, then transform it using slicing and formatting.

**input():**
- Stops the program and waits for user input.
- Returns user input as a string.
  
**Example:**
```python
user_input = input("Enter something: ")
print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```

**Key Points:**
- Always returns `str`.
- Convert to `int` or `float` if needed.
- Combine `input()` and slicing to extract particular segments of a user’s response, or format that response nicely before printing.

---

### Combining Concepts

A common scenario:
1. Prompt the user for a sentence.
2. Slice out the first word, last word, or a middle segment.
3. Print results with explanatory text using f-strings.

This fusion of I/O and string manipulation is essential in tasks like parsing commands, cleaning up data, or creating user-friendly output in interactive applications.

## 2. Exercises

We will practice reading strings, slicing them, and formatting output. Each exercise includes starter code below its description, so you can begin coding immediately.

### Exercise 1: Basic String Slicing

**Description:**  
Read a single line of text from the user and extract specific slices:

1. Extract the first 5 characters.
2. Extract the last 3 characters.
3. Extract every second character from the entire string.

**Input Example:**
```
Hello, World!
```

**Expected Output (example with `Hello, World!`):**
```
First 5 chars: Hello
Last 3 chars: d!
Every second char: Hlo ol!
```

*(Your exact spacing/format can vary, but must clearly show the slices.)*

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: string_slicing.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read a line of input into a variable 'text'.
    # 2. Print the first 5 chars.
    # 3. Print the last 3 chars.
    # 4. Print every second character.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 2: f-Strings for Personalized Output

**Description:**  
Prompt the user for their `first_name` and `favorite_color`. Use an f-string to print a sentence incorporating both.

**Input Example:**
```
Alice
blue
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hello, Alice! I hear your favorite color is blue.
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: fstring_format.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Prompt for first_name.
    # 2. Prompt for favorite_color.
    # 3. Print using an f-string: "Hello, <first_name>! I hear your favorite color is <favorite_color>."
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 3: Parsing User Input

**Description:**  
Read a line of input that contains multiple words separated by spaces. Extract:
1. The first word.
2. The last word.
3. The total number of words.

**Input Example:**
```
Python is a versatile language
```

**Expected Output:**
```
First word: Python
Last word: language
Total words: 5
```

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: parse_input.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read a line of text.
    # 2. Split it into words (hint: str.split()).
    # 3. Print the first word, the last word, and the total number of words.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### Exercise 4: Text Processing with Slices and Formatting

**Description:**  
Prompt the user for a string. Print:

1. The entire string in uppercase.
2. The first half of the string (rounded down if odd length).
3. A formatted message using f-strings, showing the length of the original string and the substring extracted.

**Input Example:**
```
abcdefghij
```

**For `abcdefghij` (length 10):**

- Entire uppercase: `ABCDEFGHIJ`
- First half (length // 2 = 5 chars): `abcde`
- Length: `10`
- Formatted message could be: `"The original string has 10 characters, and the first half is abcde."`

**Starter Code:**
```python
# Save as: text_processing.py
def main():
    # TODO:
    # 1. Read input string.
    # 2. Print the entire string in uppercase.
    # 3. Slice the first half of the string.
    # 4. Print a formatted message including the original length and the sliced half.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 3. Reference Solutions

Use these after attempting the exercises yourself.

**string_slicing_sol.py:**
```python
# Save as: string_slicing_sol.py
def main():
    text = input().rstrip('\n')
    first_five = text[:5]
    last_three = text[-3:]
    every_second = text[::2]
    print(f"First 5 chars: {first_five}")
    print(f"Last 3 chars: {last_three}")
    print(f"Every second char: {every_second}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**fstring_format_sol.py:**
```python
# Save as: fstring_format_sol.py
def main():
    first_name = input().strip()
    favorite_color = input().strip()
    print(f"Hello, {first_name}! I hear your favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**parse_input_sol.py:**
```python
# Save as: parse_input_sol.py
def main():
    line = input().strip()
    words = line.split()
    first_word = words[0] if words else ""
    last_word = words[-1] if words else ""
    total = len(words)
    print(f"First word: {first_word}")
    print(f"Last word: {last_word}")
    print(f"Total words: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**text_processing_sol.py:**
```python
# Save as: text_processing_sol.py
def main():
    text = input().rstrip('\n')
    upper_text = text.upper()
    half_length = len(text) // 2
    first_half = text[:half_length]
    print(upper_text)
    print(f"The original string has {len(text)} characters, and the first half is {first_half}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 4. Autotests

We’ll create test scripts that run both the student and reference solutions and compare the outputs. For simplicity, each test script will have a predefined set of inputs and expected outputs or rely on the reference solution for the “correct” result.

**string_slicing_test.py:**
```python
# Save as: string_slicing_test.py
import subprocess

def run_solution(solution_file, input_data):
    completed_process = subprocess.run(
        ["python3", solution_file],
        input=input_data,
        text=True,
        capture_output=True
    )
    if completed_process.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"{solution_file} crashed:\n{completed_process.stderr}")
    return completed_process.stdout.strip().split('\n')

def test_solutions(student_solution_file, reference_solution_file):
    # Test Cases:
    # 1. "Hello, World!"
    input_data = "Hello, World!\n"
    ref_output = run_solution(reference_solution_file, input_data)
    student_output = run_solution(student_solution_file, input_data)

    if len(ref_output) != len(student_output):
        raise AssertionError("Output line count mismatch.")
    for i, (r_line, s_line) in enumerate(zip(ref_output, student_output)):
        if r_line != s_line:
            raise AssertionError(f"Line {i+1} mismatch.\nExpected: {r_line}\nGot: {s_line}")

    print("All tests passed for string_slicing.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions("string_slicing.py", "string_slicing_sol.py")
```

*(You would create similar test scripts for the other exercises, each testing a set of inputs and comparing outputs. For brevity, we show only one test script in detail. The others follow the same pattern.)*

**fstring_format_test.py**, **parse_input_test.py**, and **text_processing_test.py** would each run their respective student and solution files, feed test inputs, and compare outputs line-by-line similarly.
